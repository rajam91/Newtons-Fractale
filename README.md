# Newton Fractal Generator

This Python script generates **Newton fractals**, visualizing how Newton's method converges to the roots of a complex function. Each point on the image represents a complex number, and its color shows to which root it converges and how fast.

## ðŸ“š What is a Newton Fractal?

A Newton fractal is a colorful picture that shows what happens when we use a math trick called Newtonâ€™s method to find solutions (called roots) of a complex equation. Each point in the image represents a number, and its color shows which solution it ends up at â€” and how quickly. The result looks like a beautiful mix of colors!

## Requirements

Youâ€™ll need Python 3 and a few packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
